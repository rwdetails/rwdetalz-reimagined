  {
    question: "How long does a pressure washing job take?",
    answer: "Most residential jobs take 2-4 hours depending on the size and condition of the area. Driveways typically take 1-2 hours, while full house exteriors may take 3-4 hours. We'll provide an estimated time during booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home during the service?",
    answer: "No, you don't need to be home! As long as we have access to water and the areas to be cleaned, we can complete the work. We'll send you photos when we're done and follow up via email or text.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept cash, Venmo, CashApp, and Zelle. Payment is due upon completion of the service. We'll provide an invoice with all details for your records.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book recurring cleanings?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many of our customers schedule monthly or quarterly cleanings to keep their properties looking fresh. Contact us to set up a recurring schedule and we'll offer you a loyalty discount.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean commercial properties?",
    answer: "Yes! We service both residential and commercial properties throughout Broward County. For commercial quotes, please contact us directly at (954) 865-6205 or rwdetailz@gmail.com.",

  {
    question: "Is pressure washing safe for all surfaces?",
    answer: "Yes! We use professional equipment and adjust pressure levels based on the surface type. We use soft wash techniques for delicate surfaces like roofs and painted walls, and higher pressure for concrete and driveways.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I have my property pressure washed?",
    answer: "We recommend pressure washing driveways and sidewalks 2-4 times per year, and house exteriors 1-2 times per year. Florida's climate can cause mold and algae to build up quickly, so regular cleaning helps maintain your property's value and appearance.",
